# CreditCardCustomers
 A data science project exploring different types of credit card customers using market segmentation

## Introduction
Marketing campaigns usually have one objective: selling. And the more you understand your target audience and their needs, the better your marketing campaign can be. However, some companies still use sales campaigns without knowledge about consumer behavior or buying habits toward a particular product or service. When businesses advertise their products via sales campaigns, they automatically target only those people who have shown an interest in that specific product by visiting their websites and landing pages in the past. These people are known as customers. However, through market segmentation, you can target customers based on different criteria such as age range, gender, location, etc. This makes it easier for your company to sell specific products, which can be more effective than emailing all your users indiscriminately.

In this case study, we will apply market segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques to help a particular credit card company segment different customer groups to create much more personalized and targeted ad campaigns.

## About the Dataset
In this study, we will use the [Credit Card Dataset for Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata) from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). This dataset is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables and summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders within six months.

## About the Repository
This repository will contain a series of Jupyter notebooks for each of the major phases of this study.

1. Data Cleaning Phase - In this phase, the dataset will be downloaded and assessed in order to identify potential data problems such as duplicate entries, missing values, incorrect/illogical values
